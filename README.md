**Introduction**

The Ifood Dev Week was a three-day collaborative project between Ifood and DIO focused on developing a real-life Python application for Data Science.

**Day One**

On the first day, we implemented three different approaches: imperative, functional, and object-oriented programming (OOP) methods to calculate the Net Promoter Score (NPS).

**Day Two**

During the second day, we enhanced the OOP implementation by incorporating graphical elements to perform the ETL (Extraction, Transformation, and Loading) process on the NPS data. We utilized the Matplotlib library to visualize the processed data and display the results.

**Day Three**

On the third day, we applied natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze the sentiments expressed in the comments associated with the NPS ratings. To accomplish this, we leveraged the ChatGPT API to analyze, classify, and provide feedback on the sentiments of each evaluation. This allowed us to gain qualitative perspectives and insights regarding the product's assessment by customers.

**Conclusion**

As demonstrated, the feedback generated by the ChatGPT API is highly valuable and can provide relevant insights when implemented correctly.
